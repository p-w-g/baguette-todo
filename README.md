# Le Baguette :: todo

Classic todo app with a JS OOP twist.

## purpose

The purpose of this app is having a sandbox project to learn JS OOP programming. Tasks / to-do's are pure ES6 classes with state handling. Possibly reuse it as a module in different project.

It's planned to be a part of another project in future. It holds tasks and descriptions.
